# Gabriel Bermudez (gbermudez2)
Hey! I'm Gabriel, and I'm a Bachelor of Science (Computer Science) graduate from Cal Poly Pomona. I am eager to solve problems, learn, and work as a team.

Originally, I've been interested in Computer Science, but recently have been interested in delving into the cybersecurity realm. I aim to gain more experience in the Security Operations (SOC) side of things, more specifically a role as a Tier 1 Analyst.
